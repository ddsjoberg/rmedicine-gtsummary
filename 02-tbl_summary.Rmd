- This is an abbreviated version of the example data used in the package help files/documentation. 

- note that the column have been labeled using the {labelled} package, and those are used throughout the package

- Three types of summaries: `continuous`, `categorical`, and `dichotomous`

- Default statistics are `median (IQR)` for continuous variables, and `n (%)` for categorical/dichotomous data

- Variables coded as `0/1`, `TRUE/FALSE`, and `Yes/No` are presented dichotomously by default

- Go slow here

- summarizing a data set is the MOST important analysis

- summarize data first!  you will often catch mistakes.  Data is complicated, and understanding it up front is important.

- Communicating a summary of the data ALONG with analytic results in necessary (others may catch mistakes you're not aware of)

- {gtsummary} is for presenting results, other great packages are available for summarizing data for your self (e.g. skimr)

- just one line of code

- all functions beginning with `tbl_*` create a new tables

- this is how I used the package 95% percent of the time...so easy

- three types of data shown here (explain them)

      all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})",

    digits = age ~ 2,
    missing_text = "N Unknown")
```
```{r, include=FALSE}
my_gtsave("tbl_summary_2")

.medium[
- `statistic` Report mean and standard deviation for continuous variables
- `label` Specify label for age
- `digits` Specify number of decimals to round to
- `missing_text` Text to appear for N missing

- defaults are great, let's change the default behavior

- statistics can be changed to anything...literally any R function (e.g. variance)

- discuss the formula notation
    - it's like `case_when()`, condition/variable on LHS and result on RHS
    - one formula doesn't need to be in a list, but more than one must be listed

- the vignette has examples with more examples

# {gtsummary} and formulas
.large[

Many arguments use formula syntax (or list of formulas), and provide many  options to easily select variables you want to modify.   
<br>
<br>

.center[

**_select variables_ ~ specify what you want to do** 
]



- `label = list(age ~ "Patient Age", marker ~ "Marker Level Pre-Tx")`
- `type = c(age, marker) ~ "continuous"`
- `digits = list(age ~ 0, marker ~ 2)`
- `statistic = all_continuous() ~ "{median} [{min}, {max}]"`

]

???
- case_when uses similar syntax

# tbl_summary() + helper functions

.large[
`tbl_summary()` objects can also be updated using related functions.

- `add_*()` add additional column of statistics or information, e.g. p-values, q-values, overall statistics, N obs., and more

- `modify_*()` modify table headers, spanning headers, and footnotes

- `bold_*()/italicize_*()` style labels, variable levels, significant p-values

]

???
The modify functions and the bold functions work on ALLL gtsummary tables

# cross table with tbl_cross()

- wrapper for `tlb_summary()`

```{r}
tbl_cross_1 <-
  sm_trial %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, labels = c("No", "Yes"))) %>%
  tbl_cross(trt, response,
            label = response ~ "**Tumor Responded to Treatment**",
            percent = "row",
            margin = NULL)
tbl_cross_1
```
