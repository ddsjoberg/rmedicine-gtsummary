- reproducibility in medical research is a long-reported problem, and the code is an important part of this

- Doug Altman noted the quality of medical research in 1994 and called in a scandal

- I don't need to explain this to the people here though! One of the big themes of this year's conference is reproducibility

- At European Urology we asked authors to submit their code.
    - one-third of papers with nontrivial statistics indicated they did not use code

- Nice output is HARD, and often takes a lot of custom coding and time. In a pinch, it's easier to not follow best practices.


- Wanted to create package geared towards medical research that made creating the most common tables as simple as possible

    - Make it simple
    
    - Also very flexible
    
    - Most packages for R use APA formatting...not helpful for medical journals (also, life, but that is just my opinion!)

- Eliminate the step of tweaking after you export your results
