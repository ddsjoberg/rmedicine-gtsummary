# the problem

.pull-left[.large[
- Quality of medical research is often low

- Quality of code for medical research is low/non-existent

- Low quality code is more likely to contain errors

- Reproducibility is often difficult and time-consuming

- reproducibility in medical research is a long-reported problem, and the code is an important part of this

- Doug Altman noted the quality of medical research in 1994 and called in a scandal

- I don't need to explain this to the people here though! One of the big themes of this year's conference is reproducibility

- Nature also reported the the reproducibility crisis in 2016

- At European Urology we asked authors to submit their code.
    - one-third of papers with nontrivial statistics indicated they did not use code
    - no submitted code satisfied the three basic principles of good software
    
- Nice output is HARD, and often takes a lot of custom coding and time. In a pinch, it's easier to not follow best practices.

# gtsummary: (a part of) the solution

.pull-left[.large[
- There are many tools available to increase reproducibility

- The gtsummary package makes it _incredibly_ easy to create the most common tables reported in the medical literature

???
- Wanted to create package geared towards medical research that made creating the most common tables as simple as possible
    - But also very flexible
    - Most packages for R use APA formatting...not helpful for medical journals (also, life, but that is just my opinion!)
